# Implementation of the bin



## Iteration A

TODO Cardboard prototype

## Iteration B

In a second iteration, cardboard was used again, as it is easier and faster to cut holes into it, than it is with wood. This way it would be easier to determine the correct position for the motors and the catapult. To stabilize the construction, additional cardboard was added on the inside of the bin. However, after cutting holes for the motors and the catapult, it was still not stable enough to use it in a propper manner for testing.

## Iteration C

Wood planks

### with gears

## Iteration D

Wood selfcut
